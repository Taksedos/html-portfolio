<h1>The Best Movies According to Ricardo</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 Favorite Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Into the Spiderverse</h3>
<p>ITSV's art style and animation were one of a kind, meshing comic book designs with 3D animation. In an industry constantly moving away from and undermining animation as an art form, ITSV was a breath of fresh air. 
    I have been a fan of the multiverse concept well before the whole "everything needs to have a cinematic universe" phase of the movie industry. The spiderverse especially was a concept I already enjoyed, and seeing it executed on the big screen was incredible.
    The characters themselves are full of life and each serves a purpose.

<h3>Across the Spiderverse</h3>
<p>ATSV expands upon all the positives of the previous movie. they are ranked equal in my head for different reasons, but ATSV managed to increase the scale of what the ITSV started.</p>

<h3>The Super Mario Movie</h3>
<p>The Super Mario Movie is the first animated Mario Movie, and the first Mario Movie since the failed live action Mario movie many years ago. The movie is beautifully animated, as expected from Illumination.
    The movie is very fun and provides a believable setting and backstory for the Mario Bros. Many familiar characters appear and songs play throughout the movie, so I got to point at the big screen a lot and look at my friend and say "YOO it's [X]."
    Overall fun time, watched it three times.
